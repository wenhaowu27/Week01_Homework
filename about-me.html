                </span>I am mechanical design engineer for over 20 years. I like to build stuff both real and virtual. 
            I have 20+ years of experience and established expertise in new product development of various consumer products, 
            telecommunication, wireless network device, and automobile parts manufacturing industries; 
            I spend my spare time in reading and fix electronic device. 
            I also like to programming Visual Basic in Excel.
            I am a simple person and very private person. 
            Literally, I am stereotype engineer live by strict engineering rule. 
            Other than that, I really don't have much to say about myself.
